### Why JUXT?

If you want to exploit _next-gen_ technology in your software projects today, JUXT can help.

We have extensive experience of functional programming generally, and since 2009 have harnessed Clojure for real-world problems. The two founders have each led teams that delivered large mission-critical systems in separate investment banks.

Nowadays, we're proud to say _'Clojure is our stack'_ and we have in-house expertise of many of its elements, including [Datomic](http://www.datomic.com/), [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript), [core.logic](https://github.com/clojure/core.logic), [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async) and [Pedestal](http://pedestal.io).

We consult for organisations, large and small, providing training, software development and advice. We are backed by a network of professionals who draw on comparable levels of experience to provide expert help to clients.
