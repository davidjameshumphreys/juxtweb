        <p>
          Today, many Clojure applications inherit a distribution model
          from their J2EE ancestry that involves distributable archives
          (jars, wars) containing application assets and
          dependencies. Yesterday's assumptions, however, do not
          necessarily hold today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, unlike Java, Clojure is distributable as
          source. While it is possible to compile Clojure to class files
          <em>ahead of time</em>, there usually isn't much of a benefit
          in doing so. (Many people feel, as I do, that AOT just isn't
          worth the hassle.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, deployment processes in J2EE were established long
          before the emergence of a <i>de facto</i> dependency
          management system based on Maven repositories. In the absence
          of another way of retrieving dependencies, there was no
          alternative but to distribute an app's dependencies along with
          the app. This assumption no longer holds. Dependency
          resolution is built on a mature and reliable infrastructure of
          highly available Maven repository servers, client libraries
          and checksums.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, git presents an alternative way of creating, and
          distributing, a snapshot of a directory tree. Before git, a
          version tag of a source-code repository would be meaningful
          only within the domain of the repository, so the only way of
          creating a snapshot of a directory tree that could be
          distributed was to make a copy of it inside an
          archive. Distributed version control systems bring a more
          elegant approach to the problem of freezing a directory
          tree. Tags can be used to reliably recreate a source tree. A
          git tag can be digitally signed, and the immutability of the
          commit it relates is guarenteed against corruption by
          cryptographic hash chains.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, Leiningen has evolved to become a mature and reliable
          way of launching a Clojure system from its source tree.
        </p>
        <h2>Thinking the unthinkable</h2>
        <p>
          The combination of all these developments raises the
          intriguing possibility of <em>removing the build step
          altogether</em>.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <q>The cheapest, fastest, and most reliable components are
          those that arenâ€™t there.</q>
          <cite>Gordon Bell</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          It has become something of a <i>sacred cow</i> among software
          developers that all projects should maintain at least a build
          system, or better still, a continuous integration system.
        </p>
        <!-- Worse, CI is now enshrined as a mandatory step in some
             organizations - putting an unnecessary obstacle in the way
             of progress. -->
        <p>
          The typical build system, however, interleaves two functions
          which might be better separated :-
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Checking for errors;</li>
          <li>The creation of a deriative form more suitable for execution</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          By the same token, <q>continuous integration</q> complects
          testing the quality of an artifact with its generation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Checking for errors (and ensuring quality) is definitely
          something we want to keep!
        </p>
        <p>
          But why are we so attached to the generation of artifacts?
          There are considerable advantages in making the distributable
          unit as close as we can to the source code itself. It is
          better for those engineers testing or supporting a system to
          be working on essentially <em>the same thing</em> as the
          developers who are going to be fixing the bugs they find. Of
          course, this benefit is often sacrificed for the sake of
          performance. So developers work with the original source code
          while support engineers work with something very different (a
          set of binary artifacts).
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion: Reordering the process</h2>
        <p>
          Software development processes are typically arranged around
          the bulid system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Develop -> Build -> Test -> Deploy
        </p>
        <p>
          But Clojure developers, thanks to the pervasiveness of Git and
          Leiningen in the Clojure world, have the opportunity to tinker
          with the traditional pipeline. Here's an arguably more agile
          approach :-
        </p>
        <p>
          Deploy -> Develop -> Test
        </p>
        <p>
          We'll be exploring these opportunities further in future articles.

          <!-- Expand this thesis to explain about the value of
               deploy-first - talk about remote nrepl driven

          -->

          <!-- This is a 'step up' - a degree of sophistication made
               possible by the years of development of the JVM, HotSpot,
               Clojure. -->

          <!-- 'evident' code - propagate this through to deployment -
               go back to the ike analogy -->

          <!-- 'travelling light' - going camping to a camp-site that
               has a shop for essentials you might have forgotten -
               means planning is less critical, mistakes can be made in
               the planning process - 'bugs' can be found and fixed - XP
               is predicated on the cost-of-change-curve being flat, but
               monolithic CI is not the only way to flatten it -->

          <!-- instead of investing in the CI system, invest in creating
               automation around the testing of what the users actually
               do, not some abstract analog in the form of unit
               tests. There is a place for unit-tests, see
               test-generative - but having them only gives you
               confidence in the functions you are writing, and often
               gives a false sense of security that the system will do
               what the user requires - the user is king, not the build
               system - we seem to be slaves to the CI, which distracts
               focus away from the key target: the user. 'Start-ups' who
               focus on the user, are seen as cowboys because they
               emphasise on feature delivery over unit testing. -->

          <!-- people refer to Leiningen as a build system - if it is
               then it's one of the worst build tools I've ever used -
               no where near as good as Make - Leiningen is a 'system
               launch tool' -->
        </p>
