        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          The past few years have seen the arrival of the much heralded
          'programmable web'. While the early web consisted of humans
          using the Web via their browsers, the commercial viability of
          'cloud' services together with the growth in smart-phone and
          tablet apps have placed increasing importance on making
          services available, behind the scenes, to programs. Today,
          developers have a myriad of APIs available to them via the
          Internet- such as persistent storage and backup, e-mail
          messaging, notifications, analytics, SMS, financial payments,
          social media integration, authentication and more. Adopting
          these services can be extremely cost-effective when compared
          to the equivalent development costs when building this same
          functionality inside the application. The web API has become
          the integration glue that binds an increasing number of
          applications and services together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, these services must be provided quickly, cheaply,
          and at the quality necessary for them to work cheaply and
          reliably to consumers across the planet. Implementing web
          services in Clojure is a good choice, especially for
          organisations with an existing investment in Java. Clojure has
          excellent built-in support for converting between types and
          between data structures, ideal for conversions and
          transformations necessary in exposing data to web clients. It
          also offers near seamless access to a vast range of existing
          Java libraries. Finally, Clojure is an excellent general
          purpose programming language in its own right, giving a
          breadth of features that surpass those offered within
          specialist web frameworks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you are up to speed with Clojure, you'll enjoy a rapid,
          dynamic, responsive development cycle. Plus you'll benefit
          from the maturity and performance of the Java Virtual
          Machine. This article will show how Clojure's web services
          stack is built up, layer by layer.
        </p>

        <h2 id="ring">Ring</h2>

        <p>
          We'll start with Ring. Ring provides a bridge from web
          servers, which handle the low-level socket handling and data
          buffering tasks, to web applications, which handle the
          higher-level web requests and create the responses. It is this
          bridge that allows Clojure applications to be hosted,
          unchanged, on a variety of platforms including J2EE
          application servers, Jetty, netty (with aleph) not forgetting
          on-line hosting services such as Amazon's Beanstalk and
          Heroku.

      <section>
        <h1>Getting started</h1>
        <p>
          Let's start by creating a Ring application. If you want to
          follow along and try these examples for yourself, you'll need
          the following setup :-
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>A command shell.</p></li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Java (version 1.6 or above). Either OpenJDK or Oracle's
              Java Standard Edition (available from <a              href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</a>) will suffice.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              curl (or an equivalent, such as wget or httpie) for
              command-line testing
            </p>
          </li>

          <li><p>Leiningen, version 2.0 or above.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Leiningen is the <em>de facto</em> Clojure project tool and
          installation instructions can be found here: <a
          href="http://leiningen.org/">http://leiningen.org/</a>
        </p>

        <p>
          Once you have the pre-requisites, start by creating a project using Leiningen.
        </p>

        <pre><samp class="console">lein new rest_service</samp></pre>

        <p>
          This will create a directory <code>rest_service</code>,
          containing a file <code>project.clj</code>. You should first
          edit this file to add the various libraries we'll be using
          throughout this article.
        </p>

        <figure id="fig-project-clj">
           {{#snippet}}project.clj.include{{/snippet}}
           <figcaption>{{#ref}}fig-project-clj{{/ref}}: The <code>project.clj</code> file</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Now modify the <code>rest_service/core.clj</code> file as
          shown in {{#ref}}fig-core-clj{{/ref}}.
        </p>

        <figure id="fig-core-clj">
          {{#snippet}}core.clj.include{{/snippet}}
          <figcaption>{{#ref}}fig-core-clj{{/ref}}: The initial <code>core.clj</code> file</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Now test the service with the following command :-
        </p>

        <pre><samp class="console"><kbd>lein ring server-headless</kbd></samp></pre>

        <p>
          Point your browser to <a
          href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a> and
          you should see the usual greeting, <em>Hello
          World!</em>. Alternatively, use curl to test the service as
          follows :-
        </p>

        <pre><samp class="console"><kbd>curl -i localhost:3000</kbd></samp></pre>

        <p>
          You should get the following response :-
        </p>

        <pre><code>{{#snippet}}hello-world{{/snippet}}</code></pre>

        <p>
          We achieved this by providing a function with a single
          argument (request) which returned a literal Clojure map. Ring
          requires that responses be returned as a map containing three
          entries (the response status, headers and body). Ring refers
          to functions that comply with these rules as
          <em>handlers</em>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="ring-middleware">Ring middleware</h2>

        <p>
          The beauty of Ring is in its simplicity and minimalism- we
          have already covered the Ring SPI in full! But if we were to
          write our entire application in one function it would soon
          grow too large and too expensive to maintain. To address this,
          the Ring library emphasizes a pattern (or idiom) where
          functionality can be added in successive stages. It calls
          functions that are written to this idiom 'middleware'.
        </p>

        <p>
          The idiom is straight-forward: a Ring middleware function is
          one that accepts a Ring handler as an argument and returns a
          new Ring handler that extends the functionality of the
          original. It is a functional version of the object-oriented
          interceptor pattern, <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interceptor_pattern">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interceptor_pattern</a>. Ring
          itself offers lots of such functions in its
          <code>ring.middleware</code> namespace. One example is
          <code>wrap-head</code> :-
        </p>

        <pre><samp>{{#snippet}}wrap-head{{/snippet}}</samp></pre>

        <p>
          The <code>wrap-head</code> function is typical of many Ring
          middleware functions. It takes a handler as an argument and
          returns a new handler. On receiving a HEAD request, the new
          handler calls the original handler, making the HEAD request
          look like a GET request. The original handler takes over, and
          returns the usual status, headers and body. However, the new
          handler strips out the body before returning the response to
          its caller.
        </p>

        <p>
          Notice that this functionality is entirely contained within
          the middleware function and requires no other modifications to
          the application. This idea allows us to divide our
          functionality into separate independent functions. We can
          later re-assemble those functions into a composite function
          which becomes our final Ring handler.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's see how we can use the wrap-head function in our
          example. Change the <code>core.clj</code> file as shown in
          {{#ref}}fig-using-wrap-head{{/ref}}.
        </p>

        <figure id="fig-using-wrap-head">
          {{#snippet}}using-wrap-head{{/snippet}}
          <figcaption>{{#ref}}fig-using-wrap-head{{/ref}}: Using Ring
          middleware: wrap-head</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Now test it by re-running the server
        </p>

        <pre><samp class="console"><kbd>lein ring server-headless</kbd></samp></pre>

        <p>
          and calling <code>curl</code> with an HTTP HEAD method :-
        </p>

        <pre><samp class="console"><kbd>curl -i -X HEAD localhost:3000</kbd></samp></pre>

        <p>
          You should get the following output :-
        </p>

        <pre><samp>{{#snippet}}head{{/snippet}}</samp></pre>

        <p>
          Notice that now the body has been removed and the
          <code>Content-Length</code> value is 0.
        </p>

        <h1 id="restful-web-services">RESTful web services</h1>

        <p>
          We have now seen how to create a simple web-service using Ring
          and an elegant technique of separating cross-cutting concerns
          into 'middleware' functions. But Ring's support for
          application logic <em>within</em> its handlers is quite
          basic. If you are planning to create a set of resources that
          respond only to HEAD and GET requests, and you also have
          control over the development of the client, then you should
          implement this service using only Ring middleware. The primary
          advantage of Ring middleware is its modularity which has
          enabled the emergence of numerous third-party middleware
          libraries.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's difficult, however, to create a chain of Ring middleware
          that provides the functionality of a full-featured RESTful web
          service, or at least one that is easy to configure. The
          concept of Ring middleware is based a chain metaphor, where
          each link performs some activity before handing control to the
          next link in the chain. The HTTP specification is difficult to
          implement in this linear style of control flow. Instead, it is
          easier to configure the web service by modelling it as a
          flow-chart, giving the developer the option of determining the
          outcome of <em>decision steps</em>. This is the style behind
          RESTful web service libraries such as Erlang's
          webmachine. Clojure has a similar library, Liberator, which
          provides this style of configuration.
        </p>

        <p>
          A full RESTful web service would be expected to offer support
          for other HTTP methods, such as <code>POST</code>,
          <code>PUT</code>, <code>DELETE</code> and
          <code>OPTIONS</code>. Not all methods should be handled in the
          same way, and yet completely separating the methods for the
          same resource to a different handler can lead to
          discrepancies. It should also support content negotiation,
          which allows for a resource to have multiple representations,
          the selection of which would depend on the capabilities and
          preferences of the client. This may not be relevant if your
          service is only exchanging JSON documents. However, having the
          capability for your resources to serve up CSV to Excel users,
          <em>edn</em> format to ClojureScript clients or plain-text
          lines to shell scripts can save developments costs for
          clients.
        </p>

        <p>
          RESTful services should also allow for caching of
          responses. The most effective way of getting your services to
          scale is to reduce the amount of unnecessary work they have to
          do by allowing proxies and browser caches to do their job,
          thus preventing requests from being issued in the first
          place. The HTTP specification offers 2 caching models,
          including the validation model (based on a last modified date
          or an 'ETag') and the expiry model (based on a date or a time
          to live). But these won't help without the application
          developer being involved in various decisions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Just as crucially, a RESTful service should also return the
          correct status codes and response headers. These are the
          aspects of REST that you should consider when deciding on
          whether you should use a library such as Liberator.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1 id="liberator">Liberator</h1>

        <p>Let's look now at how Liberator works. Liberator provides a
        <code>resource</code> function (and corresponding
        <code>defresource</code> macro) which builds a Ring handler from
        a map provided by the developer. Each map contains entries which
        determine how the resource should respond in certain
        situations. There are four entry types: <em>decisions</em>,
        <em>declarations</em>, <em>actions</em> and
        <em>handlers</em>.</p>

        <p>Entries can be given constant values (where decisions can be
        made at compile time) and functions (where decisions depend on
        the incoming web request and must therefore be made at
        runtime). When an entry value is a function, it is called with a
        single context argument which contains the request, the resource
        (the map defining the resource), and the negotiated
        representation, status and status message.</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Decisions</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Decisions are conditional branching points in a flow-chart
              which determine how the logic flow should
              proceed. Decisions return booleans, but can optionally
              include map entries which are merged with the context.
            </p>

            <p>
              {{#ref}}fig-exists{{/ref}} shows a number of examples
              which are all valid values for the <code>:exists?</code>
              entry.
            </p>

            <figure id="fig-exists">
              {{#snippet}}exists{{/snippet}}
              <figcaption>{{#ref}}fig-exists{{/ref}}: Valid Liberator
              settings for the <code>:exists?</code> key</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
              The final example returns a pair, containing the boolean
              decision and a map which is merged with the context,
              allowing details to be discovered and communicated to
              subsequent functions.
            </p>

          </dd>

          <dt>Declarations</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Declarations state what the resource's capabilities
              are. Here's an example of an entry that declares the
              languages in which a resource has representations :-
            </p>
            {{#snippet}}available-languages{{/snippet}}
          </dd>

          <dt>Actions</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Actions are side-effecting functions provided by the
              developer and are the only places where side-effects are
              allowed, thus isolating state mutations to a known set of
              functions. Actions are indicated by an exclamation mark
              suffix, the LISP convention for functions that mutate
              state.
            </p>
          </dd>

          <dt>Handlers</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Finally, handlers are responsible for creating the
              response body. Their keys begin with
              <code>handle-</code>. A Liberator handler receives more
              information than a Ring handler would. In addition to the
              web request, all Liberator handlers have access to the
              negotiated representation to create (the media type,
              language and possibly charset) together with the status
              and status message that has been determined prior to
              calling the handler. Freed from having to determine this
              information for itself, the handler can focus on
              generating the response body.
            </p>
          </dd>
        </dl>

      <section>
        <h1 id="content-negotiation-with-liberator">Content negotiation with Liberator</h1>

        <p>
          Let's take Liberator for a quick test drive. Modify the
          <code>core.clj</code> file as it appears in Figure 5. :-
        </p>

        <figure id="fig-liberator-mtn">
          {{#snippet}}exists{{/snippet}}
          <figcaption>{{#ref}}fig-liberator-mtn{{/ref}}: Liberator configuration for simple media-type negotiation</figcaption>
        </figure>

        {{#snippet}}liberator-mtn{{/snippet}}

        <p>Now test the service as follows :-</p>

        <pre><samp>$ <kbd>lein ring server-headless</kbd></samp></pre>
        <pre><samp>$ <kbd>curl -i -H &quot;Accept: text/html&quot; localhost:3000</kbd></samp></pre>

        <p>
          This should result in a 406 status code, because
          <code>text/html</code> isn't one of the media types that the
          service supports.
        </p>

        {{#snippet}}406{{/snippet}}

        <p>Let's try asking for one of the media-types that <em>is</em> available :-</p>

        <pre><samp>$ <kbd>curl -i -H &quot;Accept: text/plain&quot; localhost:3000</kbd></samp></pre>

        {{#snippet}}prefer{{/snippet}}

        <p>
          Liberator expects handlers to generate the representation but
          will help out in producing the response that is acceptable by
          the client. For example, if the handler produces a String, as
          in our example, Liberator will ensure that the String is
          encoded using the preferred (negotiated) charset.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since Liberator resources are Ring handlers, it is possible to
          wrap them in Ring middleware. For example, instead of having
          to generate JSON inside the handler, it could simply return a
          String which is converted to JSON in a Ring middleware wrapper
          than is able to view the results of the content negotation
          provided by Liberator. {{#ref}}fig-combine-with-ring{{/ref}} shows how
          Liberator and Ring middleware can be used together.
        </p>

        <figure id="fig-combine-with-ring">
          {{#snippet}}combine-with-ring{{/snippet}}
          <figcaption>{{#ref}}fig-combine-with-ring{{/ref}}: Combining a Liberator resource with Ring middleware</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Note: A Liberator handler can elect to return a map, and when
          it does so the map is treated as a Ring response. If the
          handler wishes to return a map of data which will be subjected
          to further processing by Ring middleware, it can tunnel the
          map inside a MapRepresentation record.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here is another common example where a <code>POST</code>
          method is used on a resource to create a subordinate
          resource. For example, a user may post a comment to a blog
          article, which might cause cause database record to be
          inserted in a table and associated with the parent
          article.
        </p>

        <p>
          {{#ref}}fig7{{/ref}} illustrates how you might configure a
          resource in Liberator to properly handle <code>POST</code>
          requests.</p>

        <figure id="fig7">
          {{#snippet}}fig7{{/snippet}}
          <figcaption>{{#ref}}fig7{{/ref}}: Handling POST requests with Liberator</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          A <code>:method-allowed?</code> function is declared which
          restricts requests to using <code>POST</code> method only. The
          <code>post!</code> action prints the form parameters but would
          usually add the comment to the data-store. Since the purpose
          of the function is to cause a side-effect, it doesn't have to
          return anything. But in this case we want to return the
          comment identifier, so we return a map containing it which is
          merged with the context. Calls to subsequence decisions,
          actions and handlers will be able to lookup this comment
          identifier.</p> <p>When using <code>POST</code>, we can elect
          to return a <code>201</code> status indicating that the
          subordinate resource has been created Or we can redirect to
          the new resource using a 303 status with the location URI of
          the new resource set in the response header. We are going to
          redirect in this example, and the <code>:see-other</code> is a
          special entry we can supply in this situation which returns
          the location of the new resource- this gets returned as the
          value of the <code>Location</code> header in the response.
        </p>

        <p>We can test this resource again with curl :-</p>

<h1 id="creating-response-bodies">Creating response bodies</h1>

<p>It is common for web frameworks to provide templating mini-languages which help in the

construction of response bodies. One of the strengths of Clojure is the ease in which hierarchical data structures can be created using literal syntax. Clojure's Hiccup library is used to convert literal Clojure syntax into well-formed markup, ideal for generating XML documents if required. For JSON, there is the choice of the data.json library, or the Cheshire library (which we are using here). These libraries allow us to form the responses in Clojure and convert them to XML and JSON. This means that we can enjoy full access to all the features of the language instead of relying on the limited features of a templating language - and we aren't forced to learn yet another syntax.</p>

<h1 id="uri-routing">URI routing</h1>
<p>Neither Ring nor Liberator dictate the form of the URIs to resources (or web services). However, whether you use Ring or Liberator, you will want to use a routing library to dispatch calls based on URIs once you have mulitple Ring handlers in your application.</p>
<p>Clojure has (at least) 2 very good routing libraries: Compojure and Moustache. Compojure provides a <code>defroutes</code> macro which allows multiple routes to be combined to form a single composite function which can be used as a Ring handler.</p>
<p>Figure 8 shows how you could use Compojure to create a URI route to the Ring handler.</p>
<p>Figure 8: &quot;Compojure routing&quot;</p>
<pre><code>(ns rest-service.core
  (:require [compojure.core :refer (GET defroutes)]))

(defroutes my-routes
  (GET &quot;/greeting/:name&quot; [name]
       (fn [request] (format &quot;Hello %s!\n&quot; name))))

(def app my-routes)</code></pre>
<p>Compojure provides a mini-language for destructuring URIs into argument values which can be referenced by your Ring handlers. More details can be found at <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/compojure/wiki/Destructuring-Syntax">https://github.com/weavejester/compojure/wiki/Destructuring-Syntax</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, Figure 9 shows what the code might look like using the Moustache routing library :-</p>
<p>Figure 9: &quot;Moustaching routing&quot;</p>
<pre><code>(ns rest-service.core
  (:require [net.cgrand.moustache :as moustache]))

(def app (moustache/app
          [&quot;greeting&quot; name]
          (fn [request]
            {:body (format &quot;Hello %s!\n&quot; name)})))
            </code></pre>
<p>A guiding principle of REST is that hyperlinks are provided to help clients navigate through a graph of resources. RESTful web services should produce content containing URI links to other resources. Neither Ring nor Liberator dictate how these URIs should be formatted, this is left up to the developer, but this consideration will be an important part of your RESTful web service. Whether you use Compojure or Moustache for routing, you should think about how you are going to construct URIs that can be embedded in your responses in addition to defining the routes in your routing library.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>This has been a brisk tour of Clojure web service basics. Clojure is an opininated language, and shares some of the principles found in REST. For instance, REST's separation between cacheable and non-cacheable methods resonates with Clojure's functional separation of immutable and mutable state. REST's emphasis on data representation as the primary artefact of communication (rather than procedure names and arguments) mirrors Clojure's emphasis on universal data structures over custom domain objects.</p>
<p>But the best reason to use Clojure for web services is that the potential for rapid development and performance is matched by the software quality that stems from Clojure's carefully crafted design. At the end of the day, web services are only useful if they are reliable.</p>
