### Why Clojure?

Today's software systems are too big, too bloated, too wasteful, too inflexible and too costly to create and maintain.

_Today's systems are way too complex._

The next generation of software systems will be dramatically simpler, yet will perform at scale. More of these will be written using __functional programming__ techniques.

Clojure is a language for building tomorrow's __next-generation systems__ on today's platforms, such as the JVM. For practical reasons, we believe Clojure is one of only a small handful of languages up to this task. While improving the software development _process_ can help, it's not nearly enough. Only by changing the way we program, by fully embracing functional programming disciplines, can we expect the orders of magnitude improvement that tomorrow's users will need.
